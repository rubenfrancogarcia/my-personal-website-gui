Hi
I'm seeking a new role where I can lead a team where I can take ownership of business outcomes using my technical expertise and experience. I have over 3.5 years in enterprise systems in the b2b telecommunications industry. I am a technology consultant and have been exclusively on a account in Verizon Partner Solutions (VPS). I have been on multiple teams across different domains within VPS as a full-stack developer. I worked closely with Verizon engineers in their migration away from vendor technology to an in-house microservice architecture utlizing a Java/Angular/Oracle DB tech stack which is projected to be saving $4 million annually.   

Previously, I have worked for Nucleos,a for-profit public benefit company in the education-tech industry. It was a startup during the early phase, and the experience was invaluable in the lessons learned in how a start-up works,testing, embracing many roles, and working with a team. Lastly, I worked for the California Cooperative Development Center, a comunnity-driven nonprofit, in web development. There I had many roles including user research, design, and development of a new initiative in a Homecare Coop. It was my first experience in web development and an invaluable experience on my software engineering journey.
